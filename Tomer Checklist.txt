1. Set up an environment with all required packages.
2. Locally- create a 'Recordings' folder and download to it the 4 recording of subject 'Fudge' (shared via Goggle drive).
2. Run the pipeline as is for subject 'Fudge', until you recieve the cross-validation performance as a plot.
3. Plot a raw mne file (it says where in the script).
4. plot an epoch file.
5. examine the change in signal between the raw (unprocessed) and epoch (processed).
6. Change some of the paramaters in the parameter dictionary, re-run the pre-processing and CV evaluation see how things change.
7. save the raw file, load it in a seperate script. Experiment with mne, maybe do your own pre-processing on it. 
You should start with the following lines from the preprocessing function so the recording is setup properly in terms of electrode type, but then you can experiment:
#remove non existent channels: 
    if 'ACC_X' in Raw.ch_names:
        Raw.drop_channels(['ACC_X','ACC_Y','ACC_Z']) ## Drop non eeg channels
    #set the correct (Brainvision Montage) montage:
    montage = mne.channels.read_custom_montage((f"{current_path}\Montages\CACS-64_REF.bvef"), head_size=0.095, coord_frame=None) 
    Raw.set_montage(montage, match_case=True, match_alias=False, on_missing='raise', verbose=None)
